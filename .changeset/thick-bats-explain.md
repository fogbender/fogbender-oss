We're working on standardizing the naming of the widgets, therefore:

- The nameless full-width widget is now known as Roomy (lots of room)
- The floating widget (Floatie) is now known as Floaty (to match the spelling of Roomy)
- We're exporting new names as aliases

FogbenderWidget -> FogbenderRoomyWidget
FogbenderSimpleWidget -> FogbenderSimpleRoomyWidget
FogbenderFloatingWidget -> FogbenderFloatyWidget
FogbenderSimpleFloatie -> FogbenderSimpleFloatyWidget
