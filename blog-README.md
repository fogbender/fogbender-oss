## How to add images for a new blog post

Use jpg or png depending on which is smaller, use https://kraken.io/web-interface to optimize the image for better compression.

Make sure that file starts with `/assets/blog`

- coverImage - 1200x(~500)px (or twice for retina)
- socialImage - 1200x630px (will be resized down by twitter/facebook/linkedin)
- thumbnailImage - 78x78px (or 156x156px for retina)
