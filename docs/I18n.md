# Internalization

We use [gettext](https://github.com/elixir-gettext/gettext) library for internalization.
`Fog.Gettext` is the main module with `gettext/1` or `ngettext/3` functions.

Gettext files are kept under `server/priv/gettext` directory. To update them from sources call `make fog-gettext`command.
