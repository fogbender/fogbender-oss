_Internal conversations_ are team messaging rooms only accessible by agents - never end users (i.e. external customers).

Internal conversations can be public (like public Slack channels - i.e., accessible by all members of your organization) or private. Fogbender does not have "SMS rooms", where the conversation is defined by its list of members.

One way to think of Internal conversations is "free Slack for unlimited users with forever history and search", but of course it's _SO_ much bigger than that, because of all the [advanced messaging features](/docs/messaging-features/overview).

While that's certainly one way to think about it, Internal conversations were initially designed to superpower [integrations with developer-facing issue trackers](/docs/issue-tracker-integrations/overview) - each external issue opened via Fogbender automatically gets an associated Internal conversations room, where the issue can be tracked and discussed without involving the customer.

All Internal conversations rooms have green header backgrounds and borders in selected state.
