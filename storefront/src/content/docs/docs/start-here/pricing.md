Fogbender pricing works as follows:

- Pricing is per-[organization](/docs/start-here/terminology)
- Unlimited [Reader](/docs/start-here/agent-roles) agents (i.e., free Slack)
- Two customer-facing agents on the house <span style="font-size: 24px; vertical-align: middle;">üçª</span> (i.e., free Intercom)
- US $25 per agent, per month for any additional customer-facing agents
- Premiums are prorated: an agent who is customer-facing for a couple of weeks in a billing cycle will cost you roughly US $12
