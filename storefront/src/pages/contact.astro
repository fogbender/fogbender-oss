          Not all chatbots are created equal. There are many factors in which bots can vary, but one
          of the biggest differences is whether or not a bot is equipped with Natural Language
          Processing or NPL. Natural Language Processing is a way for computer programs to converse
          with people in a language and format that people understand. This involves features
          including natural language understanding (understanding what the user is saying), natural
          language processing (replying to the user in a logical way), and sentiment analysis (the
          ability to understand the userâ€™s tone and intent).
