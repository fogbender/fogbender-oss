        <p>The bigger your project grows, the slower it gets. Tasks like linting, testing, and building begin to take enormous amounts of time.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>If you're serving multiple applications, you might reach for a monorepo. They're incredible for productivity, especially on the frontend, but the tooling can be a nightmare. There's a lot of stuff to do (and things to mess up). Nothing “just works.” It's become completely normal to waste entire days or weeks on plumbing—tweaking configs, writing one-off scripts, and stitching stuff together.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>We need something else.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>A fresh take on the whole setup. Designed to glue everything together. A toolchain that works for you and not against you. With sensible defaults, but even better escape hatches. Built with the same techniques used by the big guys, but in a way that doesn't require PhD to learn or a staff to maintain.</p>
